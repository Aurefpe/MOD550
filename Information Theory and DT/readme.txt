This repository contains concise, classroom-ready slide decks for two core ML topics:
- **Decision Trees** (`DT.pptx`)
- **Information Theory** (`Information Theory.pptx`)

The materials are designed for quick adoption in lectures, workshops, or self‑study. They favor plain language, minimal jargon, and visual intuition.

## 📁 Contents

- **DT.pptx** — Motivation, splitting criteria (Gini/Entropy), overfitting & pruning, Random Forest intuition, key evaluation metrics.
- **Information Theory.pptx** — Entropy, cross‑entropy, KL divergence (introduced gently), Jensen–Shannon idea, practical ML links (losses, regularization, model comparison).
- **readme.txt** — Short notes (legacy). This `README.md` supersedes it.
